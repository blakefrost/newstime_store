### Newstime

This is the newstime platform. It allows people to produce new media and sell it
through a store.

It let's people buy it, and keep it.

It liberates our thoughts, and allows ideas to transcend, harmonize and
assimilate.

This is the primary newsstand platform, where content is hosted, served and
purchased.

It has a store component which is optional in concept.

### Signing Up

The first step is signing up. Go to newstime.io/signup to get started.

### Publishing

The first step is publishing. You can construct your media for dissemination in
fashion, or you can use the integrated CMS tools to construct a well formed
document easily. The document construction is important, as this become the
platform on which to represent your idea.

To publish, upload you media to the service as an edition, along with a
signature, affirming authorship.

Your content will be available in the store once published.

You'll need to provide the title, description and some images for preview.

If you are selling the content, you will want to set a price.

If the content for dissemination is web enabled, you can simply the purchasing
experience by linking to the store, and signing the store link into the content.
This forms a loop that users can easily follow, to experience, and ultimately
purchase and acquire content they care about.

Once purchased, your content  will be download, and should be wholly formed and
work offline. If this is not the case, then you haven't sold anything, and there
are ethical questions at play.

### Discovering media

Any media can be published to the newstime platform, but the platform can also
be opensource, wholistic, and operated under a white label. For the time being,
the integrated service platform can be use to champion and find a balance.
